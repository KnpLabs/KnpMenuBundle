KnpMenuBundle
=============

The `KnpMenuBundle` provides the integration of the [KnpMenu](https://github.com/knplabs/KnpMenu)
library with Symfony2.

### What now?

The doc is available in the the `Resources/doc` folder of the bundle and the `doc` folder of the
`KnpMenu` library.

## Credits

This bundle was originally ported from [ioMenuPlugin](http://github.com/weaverryan/ioMenuPlugin),
a menu plugin for symfony1. It has since been developed by [knpLabs](http://www.knplabs.com) and
the Symfony community.
