KnpMenuBundle
=============

The `KnpMenuBundle` integrates the [KnpMenu](https://github.com/knplabs/KnpMenu)
PHP library with Symfony2. This means easy-to-implement and feature-rich menus
in your Symfony2 application!

### What now?

Documentation! The documentation for this bundle is available in the `Resources/doc`
directory of the bundle:

* Read the [KnpMenuBundle documentation](https://github.com/knplabs/KnpMenuBundle/blob/master/Resources/doc/index.md)

This bundle's job is to integrate a standalone PHP menu library called [KnpMenu](https://github.com/knplabs/KnpMenu).
You can learn a lot more about how this library works by reading that library's
documentation.

## Credits

This bundle was originally ported from [ioMenuPlugin](http://github.com/weaverryan/ioMenuPlugin),
a menu plugin for symfony1. It has since been developed by [knpLabs](http://www.knplabs.com) and
the Symfony community.
