Creating Menus as Services
==========================

This bundle gives you a really convenient way to create menus by following
a convention and - if needed - injecting the entire container.

However, if you want to, you can instead choose to create a service for your
menu object. The advantage of this method is that you can inject the exact
dependencies that your menu needs, instead of injecting the entire service
container. This can lead to code that is more testable and also potentially
more reusable. The disadvantage is that it needs just a little more setup.

Start by creating a builder for your menu. You can stick as many menus into
a builder as you want, so you may only have one (or just a few) of these
builder classes in your application:

```php
<?php
// src/Acme/MainBundle/Menu/MenuBuilder.php

namespace Acme\MainBundle\Menu;

use Knp\Menu\FactoryInterface;
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request;

class MenuBuilder
{
    private $factory;

    /**
     * @param FactoryInterface $factory
     */
    public function __construct(FactoryInterface $factory)
    {
        $this->factory = $factory;
    }

    public function createMainMenu(Request $request)
    {
        $menu = $this->factory->createItem('root');
        $menu->setCurrentUri($request->getRequestUri());

        $menu->addChild('Home', array('route' => 'homepage'));
        // ... add more children

        return $menu;
    }
}
```

Next, register two services: one for your menu builder, and one for the menu
object created by the `createMainMenu` method:

```yaml
# src/Acme/MainBundle/Resources/config/services.yml
services:
    acme_main.menu_builder:
        class: Acme\MainBundle\Menu\MenuBuilder
        arguments: ["@knp_menu.factory"]

    acme_main.menu.main:
        class: Knp\Menu\MenuItem # the service definition requires setting the class
        factory_service: acme_hello.menu_builder
        factory_method: createMainMenu
        arguments: ["@request"]
        scope: request # needed as we have the request as a dependency here
        tags:
            - { name: knp_menu.menu, alias: main } # The alias is what is used to retrieve the menu
```

>**NOTE**
>The menu service must be public as it will be retrieved at runtime to keep
>it lazy-loaded.

You can now render the menu directly in a template via the name given in the
`alias` key above:

```jinja
{{ knp_menu_render('main') }}
```

Suppose now we need to create a second menu for the sidebar. The process
is simple! Start by adding a new method to your builder:

```php
<?php
// src/Acme/MainBundle/Menu/MenuBuilder.php

// ...

class MenuBuilder
{
    // ...

    public function createSidebarMenu(Request $request)
    {
        $menu = $this->factory->createItem('sidebar');
        $menu->setCurrentUri($request->getRequestUri());

        $menu->addChild('Home', array('route' => 'homepage'));
        // ... add more children

        return $menu;
    }
}
```

Now, create a service for *just* your new menu, giving it a new name, like
`sidebar`:

```yaml
# src/Acme/MainBundle/Resources/config/services.yml
services:

    acme_main.menu.sidebar:
        class: Knp\Menu\MenuItem
        factory_service: acme_hello.menu_builder
        factory_method: createSidebarMenu
        arguments: ["@request"]
        scope: request
        tags:
            - { name: knp_menu.menu, alias: sidebar } # Named "sidebar" this time
```

It can now be rendered, just like the other menu:

```jinja
{{ knp_menu_render('sidebar') }}
```
